## 🏛️ System Architecture

VANI is built on a **Dual-Portal Infrastructure** to ensure a clear separation of concerns between stakeholders:

### 1. **Anonymous Credentialing (Student Portal)**
* **Local Hashing:** Student identities are hashed using **SHA-256** locally in the browser; original credentials never reach the server.
* **Zero-Knowledge Entry:** Access is granted via a **Private Governance Key** (12-word mnemonic), ensuring the system cannot track individual users.
* **Encrypted Repository:** Evidence is stored in an **Encrypted Evidence Repository** with strict Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.

### 2. **Institutional Oversight Dashboard (Administrative Portal)**
* **Authenticated Access:** Authorities access the dashboard via secure **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
* **Welfare Analytics:** A geospatial heat map provides real-time data on campus sentiment and high-risk areas.
* **Governance Matrix:** A collaborative AI environment where synthetic proxies negotiate equitable resolutions based on university bylaws.
